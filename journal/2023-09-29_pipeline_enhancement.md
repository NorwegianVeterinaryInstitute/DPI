# Pipeline enhancement 
date :: 2023-09-29 

Reason : 
- annotation by pairs creates duplicates at annotation, which is the most heavy step
- this is not effective and impedes running a lot of comparison 

What needs to be done : 
- The annotation module must run alone, and then pairs need to be reconstitued 
- Find a solutions to do so

MYPATH="/cluster/projects/nn9305k/active/evezeyl/projects/OEIO/git/DPI/assets/data" 
MYBIN="/cluster/projects/nn9305k/active/evezeyl/projects/OEIO/git/DPI_dev/DPI/bin"
apptainer shell --bind $MYPATH:/data,$MYBIN:/data/bin $IMGS/evezeyl-checkr.img 

cd /data 
Rscript bin/input_check.R --input $INPOUT
```
So this works this is not the R script Nor the image 
- it can be a problem of bind ? at redirect to path ? 

Testing in one of the pipeline dir 

```bash 

MYPATH=$(pwd)
MYBIN="/cluster/projects/nn9305k/active/evezeyl/projects/OEIO/git/DPI_dev/DPI/bin"
IMGS="/cluster/work/users/evezeyl/images"
apptainer shell --bind $MYPATH:/data,$MYBIN:/data/bin $IMGS/evezeyl-checkr-latest.img 

cd /data 
Rscript bin/input_check.R --input saga_test.csv
```
ok, its because of the bind - it cant follow the path 
Needed to add environment variable for .bashrc and testing

Well I added the bind and this still does not work 
trying to see if the exec command is working

```bash 

IMGS="/cluster/work/users/evezeyl/images"
apptainer exec $IMGS/evezeyl-checkr-latest.img Rscript /cluster/projects/nn9305k/active/evezeyl/projects/OEIO/git/DPI_dev/DPI/bin/input_check.R --input saga_test.csv
```

This works so WHY ? 

- trying to copy the file so it bypass the mount using in process `  stageInMode 'copy'` that copy the file but still not working
- trying to use latest nf version nextflow_23.04.4 (should not do huge doiff)

ok, was interaction with Rprofiles ... 

--- 2023-10-02 worflow and modules reformated --- last testing to see if works :)

# Testing now with fagerlund data and says inputfile is missing .... 
but when I echo the path of the file and I launch in the directory this works 
when I test with the small input file this works ... 
but I was in a tmux session ... try tmux session with testdata 
test working with tmux
