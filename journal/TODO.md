# TODOs 

## Absolutely
- [ ] Find a was to get the database step one by one for first module ? wrangling to DB
- [ ] Find a way to make the Json to db linear ? so it does not overwride the db

## Would be nice 
- [ ] find a way to make containers pre-download - one by one - this is making system crash to download too many at once 
- [ ] how to get the relative paths from csv files ? - did not work with ${}projectDir} - for testing purposes
