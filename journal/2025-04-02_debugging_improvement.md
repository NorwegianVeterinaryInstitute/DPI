# Step 1 - Retesting that the pipeline runs on a minimal test

First debugging - files are not linked anymore to the database 
It might be because I had modified the code - my previous attemps to fix that
The data is not symlinked for the database so it cannot run 

But first I need to check the channel  output 
ok - so I think I need to use the sql function of nextflow is out now. 
I need to update to the correct nextflow version
then I need to update the python script to be able to add the data to the database
it will then be a sql database and not a sqlite database


<!-- was here before modif - could restore specific folders as is 
I need to restor to commit ID  or to take those files from there : 7e50c99
git diff 7e50c99 -- modules

git checkout 7e50c99 -- modules
git checkout 7e50c99 -- workflows
-->


# Step 2 - Step by step modification of modles and resutls - deleted previous results

```shell
# testing pipeline
cd /cluster/projects/nn9305k/active/evezeyl/projects/OEIO/git/DPI_dev/DPI
./2025_test_run.sh
# testing python script
cd /cluster/projects/nn9305k/active/evezeyl/projects/OEIO/2025_TEST_DPI/results

``` 
1. annotating only the samples 
2. check if some results of the samples needed to be added to the database
- json results for samples from annotation need to be added - starting rewriting this

- [x] testing arguments for the script function
```bash
cd /cluster/projects/nn9305k/active/evezeyl/projects/OEIO/2025_TEST_DPI/results/02_ANNOTATE

IMG="/cluster/work/users/evezeyl/images/evezeyl-py_test-latest.img"

apptainer shell $IMG

``` 

This sage is now working - commiting the changes before continuing the dev. 
Commit id : 28f779c
 

- [ ] implementing adding json results to the database
Test run 
```bash
cd /cluster/projects/nn9305k/active/evezeyl/projects/OEIO/2025_TEST_DPI/results/02_ANNOTATE

ok now I fixed the adding of json results to the database
launched the pipeline to get the rest of the results

- add the gff results to the database
```bash
cd /cluster/projects/nn9305k/active/evezeyl/projects/OEIO/2025_TEST_DPI/results/04_NUCDIFF/SRR11262179_SRR11262033

```
This is working. 

Restructuting the code so I can use modules better.
Retesting 
Ok it seems to be working now - continuing

- Now need to add the vcf annotated results to the database 

```bash

cd /cluster/projects/nn9305k/active/evezeyl/projects/OEIO/2025_TEST_DPI/results/06_VCF_ANNOTATOR
IMG="/cluster/work/users/evezeyl/images/evezeyl-py_test-latest.img"
apptainer shell $IMG
SCRIPT="/cluster/projects/nn9305k/active/evezeyl/projects/OEIO/git/DPI_dev/DPI/bin/results_to_db.py"

# $SCRIPT --result_file SRR11262179_SRR11262033_query_snps_annotated.vcf  --result_type vcf --id SRR11262033 --database 2025_DPI_test.sqlite --comment test


$SCRIPT --result_file SRR11262179_SRR11262033_query_snps_annotated.vcf  --id SRR11262033 --database 2025_DPI_test.sqlite --comment test
```

This appears tobe working
I want to test if the function test is working

```bash
cd /cluster/projects/nn9305k/active/evezeyl/projects/OEIO/2025_TEST_DPI/results/06_VCF_ANNOTATOR
IMG="/cluster/work/users/evezeyl/images/evezeyl-py_test-latest.img"
apptainer shell $IMG
SCRIPT="/cluster/projects/nn9305k/active/evezeyl/projects/OEIO/git/DPI_dev/DPI/bin/funktions/vcf_to_df.py"
python $SCRIPT
```

- now I need to add the stats file 

```bash
cd /cluster/projects/nn9305k/active/evezeyl/projects/OEIO/2025_TEST_DPI/results/04_NUCDIFF/SRR11262179_SRR11262033
IMG="/cluster/work/users/evezeyl/images/evezeyl-py_test-latest.img"
apptainer shell $IMG
SCRIPT="/cluster/projects/nn9305k/active/evezeyl/projects/OEIO/git/DPI_dev/DPI/bin/results_to_db.py"
$SCRIPT --result_file SRR11262179_SRR11262033_stat.out  --result_type stats --id SRR11262033 --database 2025_DPI_test.sqlite --comment test

# modified auto detection result type
$SCRIPT --result_file SRR11262179_SRR11262033_stat.out  --id SRR11262033 --database 2025_DPI_test.sqlite --comment test
```
ok - working


**FIXES that were needed - and now summary and continuing fixes 
- [x] add comment table to the database - can be used for fast ckecking duplicates ...
- [x] automatic detectionof result types (I do not export the function - its an helper)

- [x] reformatting the nf pipeline to allow adding the results to the database
- [x] debugging - the output in table is not the correct tables - need to check python script and lack tables. Vcf and gff are not added to the database. 
- changed ' to "" in python script when passing arguments (I do not think was the problem but making sure)
- ? modules to make the script not loaded - maybe : tested gff vcf and stats - all working - duplicates in database when run so need to check that when rest is fixed
- so the problem is probably in the channels it receives. ok, needed to transform the channel - the maxfork runs once so a bit tricky 
- [x] changed the channels and merging to have all results in one channel (id, resultfile)
- [x] implementing in pipeline for testing on several files
Working but is slow - wont be able to process many isolates 

2025-04-10 
- [ ] optimizing pipeline (involves restructuring the scripts and some modules)
Allow each results to be added to a single database, then merge the results of all sqlite databases into a single database.
The checking of already existing data will then be done during the merging process, because only new data for the single database. 
    - [ ] rewriting of results_to_db.py (simplification, and reformating to better python) + testing
    - [ ] rewriting of process_result_file - simplification (no control of existing data in sqlite) + testing 
    - [ ] changing the workflow and adding merging module into a single database 


Testing the new results_to_db.py (before modifying the process_result_file)
```bash
cd /cluster/projects/nn9305k/active/evezeyl/projects/OEIO/2025_TEST_DPI/results/04_NUCDIFF/SRR11262179_SRR11262033

```
- The script results_to_db.py is functionning   

Modifying the process_result_file.py - simpyfying and making more effective


Hi, I need you to help me make some change to a pyton script (module) that is run by a main python script. 
There are elements I want to write differently and some that just need to be removed, because it will be taken over by another script, later in the process (its part of a pipeline). 
I need to make the module script faster also (I will paste it bellow). 
It will only be used to process one file at the time, and append the results to sqlite connection (the database is created by the main script).
Here is what needs to be changed: 
It does not need to check for duplicates in the database (as all will be new, this part will be handled from another script, later on, all the data that will be added is unique). 
Can you make the changes ? 


- [x] ? missing data in features, need to add NaN (None in sqlite) to all other columns - handled for all types of data
- [ ] check if the unittest are working and improve them
- [ ] automatic script to run unittesting 
- [ ] optimization sqlite writing in database - need to have it add data efficiently (at the end because basic functions have to work)
- [ ] check and adjust the log file for the scripts - so its is easy to detect errors and where 

# Helpers gemini 
Hi, can you make an unittest for this file : xx.py. I want to be able to have the result in a jupyter notebook, your explanations included
